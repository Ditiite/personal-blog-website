                <p class="author-bio">Hello, my name is Dita. I'm from Latvia. But for many years my home country is
                    Finland. Few years ago I got interested in programming and started to learn from different sources
                    Front End development. After hard work, I finally got my first job as SW developer in the dream
                    company Tietoevry Oy.
                    Three years ago I got pregnant with my first baby and last year I gave birth to my second baby.
                    While sitting home with her I got interested in macrame. And now it's my hobby. <span class="underline bold italic">Love</span> creating and
                    inventing new designs. It's like meditation.

                <h3>Story how it's started</h3>
                <p><span class="tab">While</span> I was sitting home in parental leave with my second baby, I was looking for some interesting nursery decorations.
                    Some pieces from macrame catch my eyes. I decided to try out. I found this beautiful tutorial, ordered cord and tried it out.
                    It was like meditation. Although it wasn't easy to start, I found it so <span class="bold green">relaxing</span> and soon I was addicted to macrame.
                    I wasted to try out more and more things to make. Now it's may hobby and I love it.

                <p><span class="tab"></span>I am so glad I decided to knot my first knot and didn't scared of trying something new. As I have found the way tor relax my brain after stressful and rush full day.</p>
